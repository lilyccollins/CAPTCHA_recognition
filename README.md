# CAPTCHA_recognition
CAPTCHAs are automated tests designed to distinguish between humans and machines. As machine learning techniques improve and make it easier for malicious programs to solve CAPTCHA tests, some researchers work to help companies like Google improve their CAPTCHA tests by developing computer programs capable of solving CAPTCHAs and publishing their feedback. This project aims to do the same by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reliably decipher text-based CAPTCHA tests. Our model was trained on a dataset of labeled, text-based CAPTCHAs from Kaggle datasets. This dataset consisted of 1070 images of distorted text labeled with the corresponding five character deciphered text. To do this, we constructed a four layer CNN followed by five parallel, fully-connected, three layer neural networks. Each of these five parallel networks worked to output one of the five characters in the final output. Our model achieved an average accuracy rate of  78.5% on the test data, which is comparable to the accuracy humans achieve on these tests: 87%. These findings suggest that companies like Google that offer CAPTCHA tests must carefully reevaluate their assumptions about the differences between a human and a machine and redesign their CAPTCHA service.
